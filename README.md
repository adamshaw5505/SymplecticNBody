## Symplectic N-Body Code Comparison

This project simulates N-body collisions of point particles with varying mass using Newton's law of gravitation. 
We compare the standard Runge-Kutta integrators with Symplectic integrators in their energy conservations.

### Compiling and Running
"nbody.py" contains the base code for running the individual simulation files.
The named files are named after their physical/theoritical setups.

Running each file as "python filename.py" should produce a graph of the energy vs time for each simulation.
